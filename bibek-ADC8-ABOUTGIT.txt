git clone
git clone is a Git command line utility which
is used to target an existing repository and create a clone,
or copy of the target repository.

git push
The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a 
remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local
repository to a remote repo. It's the counterpart to git fetch ,
but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches,
pushing exports commits to remote branches.

git pull
git pull is a Git command used to update the local version of a repository from a remote.
By default, git pull does two things. Updates the current local working branch (currently checked out branch)
Updates the remote tracking branches for all other branches.

merge conflict
Merge conflicts happen when you merge branches that have competing commits,
and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate 
in the final merge.

git branches
A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. 
The default branch name in Git is master .
As you start making commits, you're given a master branch that
points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, the master
branch pointer moves forward automatically

git commit

Git-commit is a commit, or "revision", is an individual
change to a file (or set of files). It's like when you save a
file, except with Git, every time you save it creates a unique
ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record
of what changes were made when and by who.
